# Roy Lab



## Research Overview

**Roy Lab** focuses on fluorescent imaging and rodent brain research to understand the molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms underlying higher-order cognitive processes. Our long-term mission is to determine how disease states alter neural mechanisms that underlie cognition and to identify therapeutic strategies to alleviate disease phenotypes.

## Cognitive Processes of Interest

- Working Memory
- Long-Term Memory Encoding and Retrieval
- Attention
- Decision-Making

We aim to build on basic science questions to explore disease states and their impact on cognition.

## Key Areas of Research

**Neocortex and Thalamus:**
- The expanded neocortex in humans underlies superior cognitive functions.
- Cortical functions depend on integrating internal states (emotion) and external information (sensory inputs).
- The thalamus guides cortical processes, being crucial for sensory processing and multi-sensory integration.

## Techniques and Approaches

Our laboratory employs various advanced techniques:
- Single-cell RNA sequencing
- Brain-wide activity mapping
- Circuit tracing
- In vivo neural activity measurements (fiber photometry, one-photon calcium imaging)
- CRISPR
- Neural manipulation approaches (chemogenetics, optogenetics)
- Computational modeling
- Human organoid models

## Research Projects

### 1. Thalamic Cell Types and Circuits Underlying Cognition
We identify novel or understudied cell types in the rodent thalamus using transcriptomic approaches. Genetic tools (mouse lines or viral constructs) are developed for in vivo access, linking these cell types and circuits to specific cognitive processes using behavioral and neural activity readouts.

### 2. Intersection of Computation and Neuroscience Research
Our experimental systems neuroscience findings help us understand the computational functions of the brain. We build synaptic plasticity frameworks and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to probe detailed plasticity mechanisms and develop additional hypotheses for experimental studies.

### 3. Thalamic Dysfunction in Psychiatric and Neurodegenerative Disorders
We study thalamic dysfunction in disease states, including psychiatric (autism, schizophrenia) and neurodegenerative (Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s) disorders. Understanding these phenotypes is crucial for exploring therapeutic targets.

### 4. Developing Human Organoid Models
To bridge the gap between animal and human applications, we are developing human organoid models. These models help us understand cortical and thalamocortical mechanisms, utilizing patient samples to generate organoid models for therapeutic target exploration.
