# Hi there 👋

Welcome to the **Roy Lab** GitHub page!

## 🌟 About Us

At **Roy Lab**, we delve into the fascinating world of fluorescent imaging and rodent brain research. Our mission is to decode the molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms that drive higher-order cognitive processes like memory, attention, and decision-making. By understanding these processes, we aim to uncover how diseases alter neural mechanisms and identify therapeutic strategies to combat these changes.

## 🔬 Research Focus

We are particularly interested in:
- **Working Memory**
- **Long-Term Memory Encoding and Retrieval**
- **Attention**
- **Decision-Making**

Our research begins with fundamental science questions and extends to understanding disease impacts and therapeutic development.

## 🧠 Key Research Areas

### Neocortex and Thalamus:
- The neocortex's role in human cognitive superiority.
- Integration of internal states (emotion) and external information (sensory inputs).
- The thalamus's function in sensory processing and multi-sensory integration.

## 🛠 Techniques and Approaches

We use cutting-edge methods such as:
- Single-cell RNA sequencing
- Brain-wide activity mapping
- Circuit tracing
- In vivo neural activity measurements (fiber photometry, one-photon calcium imaging)
- CRISPR
- Neural manipulation (chemogenetics, optogenetics)
- Computational modeling
- Human organoid models

## 📚 Our Projects

### 1. Thalamic Cell Types and Circuits
Discovering and genetically targeting novel cell types in the rodent thalamus to link them to cognitive functions through behavioral and neural activity studies.

### 2. Computation and Neuroscience
Using experimental neuroscience findings to enhance our understanding of brain computation, developing synaptic plasticity frameworks and recurrent neural networks (RNN).

### 3. Thalamic Dysfunction in Disorders
Exploring thalamic dysfunction in psychiatric (autism, schizophrenia) and neurodegenerative (Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s) disorders to identify therapeutic targets.

### 4. Human Organoid Models
Bridging the gap between animal studies and human applications by developing human organoid models to study cortical and thalamocortical mechanisms, using patient samples for therapeutic research.
